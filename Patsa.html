<h2>Process: </h2>
<pre>
1-Boil 150 grams of pasta according to instructions on the package. I used regular penne pasta which was supposed to be boiled for 9 to 11 minutes. and drain. Make sure you don’t overcook your pasta, you want it al-dente. Note: use only 1 cup pasta if you like more sauce in your pasta. While the pasta is boiling chop all the veggies.

2- Drain the pasta using a colander and set aside once the pasta is boiled.

3- Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan on medium heat. Add all the veggies –
1 small red onion, chopped
1 medium red pepper, sliced
3/4 cup small broccoli florets
1/2 cup sweet corn (frozen corn which I added to hot water for 5 minutes before using).

4- Cook the veggies for 2 minutes. They should remain crunchy. You can use other veggies like carrots, peas as well.

5- Once done, remove veggies onto a plate.

6- To another pan or use the same pan, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the remaining tablespoon of butter.

7- Once the butter melts, add the 5-6 chopped garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

8- Then add in 1 & 1/2 tablespoons of flour.

9- Whisk the flour continuously, using a wire whisk for around 30 to 60 seconds. You don’t have to brown the flour much.

10- Then add in 2 cups of milk. You can also add 1/4 cup heavy cream here or use additional 1/4 cup milk.

11- Mix everything using a whisk so that there are no lumps formed.

12- Add in the seasonings:

1 teaspoon Italian seasonings
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes (to taste)
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
black pepper, to taste

13- Mix in everything and let the sauce simmer.

14- Sauce will thicken as it simmers and in 4 to 5 minutes it will coat the back of the spoon. Turn heat to lowest.

15- Add in the veggies and the boiled pasta.

16- Toss until the pasta and veggies are coated with the sauce. Taste test and adjust the seasonings at this point. Serve warm!

And your delicious pasta is Ready.
